This is an emulator project for the CHIP-8 archictecture, used to play
video games in the late 80s / early 90s.  I have started working on this
project because I have been having trouble understanding pointers.

Things I have also learned along the way:
	- Basics of constructing a Makefile 7/25/2018
	- a better (but not complete) understanding of how fread() works 08/09/18
	- a little bit about endianness 08/09/18
